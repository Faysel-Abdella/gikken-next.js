    body: "This translator is a real miracle - in terms of functionality, in terms of its translation, and finally, in terms of customer care! I started using Mate when it wasn't that popular, but was just starting its journey to fame, and even then I liked everything about it (before that I used Deepl), but Mate proved that it's the best! And then another surprise - a letter came to my mailbox that since I've been with Mate from the very beginning, the campaign gave me lifetime Pro access! Thank you, Mate! Good luck to you!",
